## hey there â™¡ â‚ŠËšà¬˜(à©­*ËŠáµ•Ë‹)à©­*â€ŠÌ€Ë‹

I'm Suhani Surya â€” a Systems Design Engineering student @ UWaterloo with a love for building intentional products and learning by doing. Iâ€™m super curious, people-oriented, and always chasing that sweet spot between creativity and technical problem-solving ðŸ’¡âœ¨

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve worn many hats in past roles â€”  
â†’ At **Hatch**, I worked with rail systems engineers and coders to simulate train operations and build tools that made team workflows smoother ðŸš‰ðŸ›   
â†’ At **The Food Society Canada**, I helped bridge tech and storytelling to promote culturally diverse food systems ðŸ¥ŸðŸ“£

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently exploring software, product, and infra roles for Fall 2025 â€” and always happy to connect over code, culture, or cafe recs â˜•ðŸŒ¸
